# HoosExchange

HoosExchange is an online thriftshop for CVille locals and UVA students. HoosExchange was created at the 2023 HooHacks Hackathon with the intention of offering a way for students and CVille locals to easily buy and sell used clothes, shoes, and accessories - all while making a positive environmental impact. Post some of your clothes on HoosExchange today, and see what an impact it has!
